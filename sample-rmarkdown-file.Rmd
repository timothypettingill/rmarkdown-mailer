## Nice/Naughty List Confirmation

Dear `r params$first_name` `r params$last_name`,

I have been watching you when you are awake and when you are
sleeping. After carefully evaluating your actions and checking twice
I am `r ifelse(params$list == "nice", "pleased", "saddened")` to inform you
that you have been placed on the `r params$list` list.


Sincerely,

Santa Claus
